            Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) denotes a highly competent
            computer system that can perform a broad set of human tasks.
            Definitions vary both as to the quality of performance (from median
            human to as good as the best humans) and the range (from most tasks
            to all tasks). The broad variety of definitions presents a problem
            for forecasts. This dashboard sidesteps this problem by taking the
            median of a set of predictions based on different definitions. See
            the FAQ for more.

                    probably be sufficient. This would likely involve a computer
                    system demonstrating human-like intelligence through
                    extended text-based conversations with expert judges who are
                    actively trying to identify the AI.

                  <p>
                    The test would require the AI to demonstrate natural
                    language understanding, reasoning, knowledge across domains,
                    and the ability to respond coherently to unexpected
                    questions. Resolution would occur when a credible
                    organization or panel confirms that an AI has successfully
                    passed such a test, fooling a significant portion of
                    qualified judges into believing it&apos;s human, while
                    demonstrating capabilities consistent with general
                    intelligence rather than narrow expertise.

                  <p>
                    There is significant disagreement about what constitutes
                    AGI. Rather than pick one definition, we aggregate and
                    display predictions across different definitions to capture
                    the broader forecaster consensus on transformative AI
                    timelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is always going to be possible to argue that the set of
                    averaged definitions is incorrectly weighted. To reduce bias
                    I seek to accept all, long-term or highly liquid forecasts
                    of AGI and then weight them equally. Perhaps we will
                    down-weight some if a single institution releases many
                    different AI forecasts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you disagree, please get in touch. If you know of some
                    other forecast of AGI that I have not included, let me know.

                    All of these charts are turned into a single index—the index
                    is a straight average of each different source. There is one
                    deviation and some clarifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Kalshi prediction:</strong> All the other
                    predictions are date predictions—forecasters were able to
                    give their whole range of predictions. But the Kalshi
                    prediction is a binary prediction—will the AI pass the
                    Turing test before 2030? It can only be answered with a yes
                    or no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So I took the average of the other predictions, and then
                    adjusted the weights of that prediction before and after
                    2030 to make them match the Kalshi prediction. This formula
                    is as follows:
                  </p>
                  <p className="rounded bg-gray-100 p-3 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-gray-700">
                    P(AGI on date Xi, before 2030) = (average of all other
                    predictions for date Xi / average of the sum of predictions
                    on date Xi) * Kalshi P(AGI before 2030)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then the index is the average of all Xi values,
                    including this new one for Kalshi.

                    If you want a longer explanation, I&apos;ve tried putting
                    this into Claude and it seems to understand and be able to
                    answer questions. So literally copy the above block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The confidence area:</strong> This is the 80% (10th
                    and 90th) confidence interval on the lines in the chart.
                    It&apos;s not just the union of their own 80% confidence
                    intervals, since that would be far wider.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Manifold prediction:</strong> This has a 2050
                    end date. There is a moderate bump in probability in this
                    bucket. This should probably be clarified to mean that any
                    time after 2049 resolves to the 2050 bucket, since that
                    seems to be what people have understood it to mean. There
                    isn&apos;t much probability in the bucket so we have ignored
                    this, but we could return to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Date prediction buckets:</strong> The date
                    predictions have different buckets. I can&apos;t remember
                    what we did with them but I guess we averaged across
                    buckets. This is plausibly less accurate than fitting them
                    to a curve and using that to do a weighted average, but
                    we&apos;re using it for medians, 10th and 90th percentiles.
                    I doubt it makes much difference.

                    The 80% confidence interval is calculated using the 10th and
                    90th percentiles from the combined forecast distribution.
                    This means there&apos;s roughly a 10% chance AGI arrives
                    before the lower bound and a 10% chance it arrives after the
                    upper bound.

                  <p>
                    We chose 80% because it provides a meaningful range without
                    being so wide as to be uninformative. This could change in
                    the future if there&apos;s good reason to use a different
